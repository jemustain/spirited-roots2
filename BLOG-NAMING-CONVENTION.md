## 📝 Naming Standard

**Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-slug.md`

**Example**: `2025-09-06-easy-natural-skincare-routine.md`

## ✅ Current Blog Posts (Chronological Order)

1. `2025-09-02-no-bake-energy-balls-homeschool-snacks.md`

3. `2025-09-04-violet-mama-natural-living-journey-begins.md`

## 📋 Guidelines for New Posts

### **1. Date Format**
- Use the **publication date** (when the post goes live)
- Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601 standard)
- Example: September 6, 2025 = `2025-09-06`

### **2. Descriptive Slug**
- Keep it **concise but descriptive** (3-6 words)
- Use **hyphens** instead of spaces
- Include **primary keyword** when possible
- Avoid articles (a, an, the) unless essential

### **3. Good Slug Examples**
- `natural-skincare-routine`
- `homeschool-math-activities`
- `eco-friendly-cleaning-products`
- `mindful-parenting-tips`
- `organic-baby-clothes-review`

### **4. Frontmatter Requirements**
Ensure the `slug` field in frontmatter matches the filename:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
slug: "2025-09-06-descriptive-slug"
