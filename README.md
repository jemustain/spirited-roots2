# SpiritedRoots Affiliate Blog

Hey there! I'm Emily, a homeschool mom, software engineer, and nature lover helping other moms discover joyful, natural ways to thrive with their families. ðŸŒ¿

This is my affiliate marketing blog focused on natural living for homeschooling families - built with love, code, and the same GitHub CI/CD practices I use in my engineering work!

## About This Project

SpiritedRoots is where I share honest reviews of eco-friendly kids' clothing, healthy recipes for busy homeschool days, and self-care tips that actually work for real moms. As a software engineer who values both technology and tech-life balance, I've built this site to be fast, SEO-optimized, and perfect for sharing the natural products that make family life more vibrant.
