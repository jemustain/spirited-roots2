# Violet Mama Affiliate Blog

Hey there! I'm Violet, a mom, software engineer, and nature lover helping other families discover joyful, natural ways to thrive together. ðŸ’œ

This is my affiliate marketing blog focused on natural living and mindful motherhood - built with love, code, and the same GitHub CI/CD practices I use in my engineering work!

## About This Project

Violet Mama is where I share honest reviews of eco-friendly family products, healthy recipes for busy days, and mindful motherhood tips that actually work for real families. As a software engineer who values both technology and work-life balance, I've built this site to be fast, SEO-optimized, and perfect for sharing the natural products that make family life more vibrant.
