<!-- This would normally be a binary ICO file, but I'll create an HTML file that can be converted -->
<!-- To create favicon.ico, you can:
1. Use an online converter like favicon.io or realfavicongenerator.net
2. Upload the favicon.svg file I created
3. Download the generated favicon.ico and place it in the public folder

For now, the SVG favicon will work in modern browsers -->
